# Model for Resale Flat Prices in Singaporean HDB Units

A predictive machine learning model for the resale flat prices for Singaporean HDB units, based on their location and registration date

Uses RandomForestRegressor, and achieved an RSquared of 0.88 / 88% for the base model (1 extra column, being the age of the HDB) - Took around 5 minutes to fit, careful!

WIP a model with geographical feature as an additional point, see below
